      <p align="middle">"Hi my name is Andy. I enjoy photography and have recently started to get serious with programming. Additionally, I also enjoy traveling and skateboarding. I feel that my hobbies have allowed me to meet very talented and interesting people from all walks of life. I now hope that exploring the vast and amazing world of technology will allow me to do the same"
